## CivicConnect – Civic Issue Reporting Platform

CivicConnect is a web application that allows users to report civic issues in their local area and track them digitally.  
This project was built to understand how real-world problems can be solved using full-stack development.

## Why I built this project

I built CivicConnect to learn how a real civic issue reporting system works.  
I noticed that common problems like potholes, broken streetlights, and cleanliness issues are reported but often not tracked properly.

This project helped me understand frontend-backend communication, map integration, and API handling in a practical way.

## Challenges faced

Integrating maps and handling location data was challenging at first.  
Connecting frontend and backend APIs and debugging issues also helped me improve my problem-solving skills.
